    <p>Of some note is that none of my galleries are squeaky clean. While I do not draw outright porn,
        there will definitely be a fair bit of artistic nudity. Though at least on Deviantart and Furaffinity
        you won't see them if you do not have an account, so safe in that regard.

            <li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/crazedcollie" target="_blank">Deviantart</a>
            My oldest art account. Contains over 900 pieces since my humble beginnings of posting
            art online in 2004.</article></article></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/crazedcollie" target="_blank">Furaffinity</a>
            In contrast, my FurAffinity account is not as old... or rather, I haven't actually had an
            active gallery there for that long. Last few years of my art, so probably the best place
            to 'get' what I draw these days.</li>
            <li><a href="https://pawb.fun/@CrazedCollie" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> Artsocial
            number one. I don't do that much here, but I do post my new drawings there.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/crazedcollie" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> Artsocial
            number two. Exists at least as much for me to ogle and repost other artists than post my
            own. Most likely to contain non-art related opinions as a side order.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>About the artist</b><br>
        Since you are still here, I imagine you want to know about me and not just my art.<br>
        I'm an IT/trade student in my late 30's (in the middle of a career change), freelancing
        as an artist as a small side gig. I live in Southern Finland with my sister Seija, my wife
        Charlotte, and our dorky Tibetan Spaniel Ukko and derpy Ragdoll Aslan.<br>
        I have been drawing since my teens, and what started as scribbles on notebooks on boring
        school lectures slowly evolved into my longest-standing hobby. I started drawing with just
        pencil, tried all kinds of things in between (did solely digital art for a few years)...
        and now I draw purely traditional, mostly pencil art again.</p>
