    <h1>Commissions</h1>
    <p>If you want to commission art from me, a few guidelines to start with.<br>
    I can <i>try</i> to draw most anything, but my expertise is most certainly in the venues of the anthro and furry art,
    and largely (read: almost solely) female characters at that. I have never drawn a photorealistic portrait, for example, so you are better
    off finding that elsewhere.<br>
    Payment via PayPal (link below), half before I start and the other half upon completion.</p><hr>
    Will draw:
    <ul>
        <li>Character art that's anywhere on the whole range between human and feral critter</li>
        <li>Saucy stuff and nudes</li>
        <li>ponies, Pokémon and other fandom stuff</li>
    </ul>
    Will not draw:
    <ul>
        <li>Porn/sex (can't draw it to save my life)</li>
        <li>extreme fetish art</li>
        <li>gore or overt violence</li>
    </ul>

          <p><b>The Basic Deal: 80€</b><br>
          Pencil with as much detail as you give me and I am able to do. This is my definite comfort
        zone, and my best art all resides in pieces like this.
        <br>
        This sort of piece does tend to come with at least stylized background, though odds are random foliage
        or other background details just kind of <i>happen</i> unless you are against me doing it. Consider it
        a bonus for letting me pencil doodle your commission.

          <p><b>Added inks and color: +50€</b><br>
          Inking the lines and doing a color with your choice of either: color pencils, promarkers,
        or the combination of both. Pencils create the softest traditional look, markers the best color contrast,
        and the combination of the two probably the smoothest overall result.</p>

          Additional character is always a bit more extra work in figuring out poses and how to
        arrange the picture.</p>
